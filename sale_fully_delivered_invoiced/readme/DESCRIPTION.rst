The standard field invoice_status show information about the status invoices related
to a sales Order. However, it can be "invoiced" when the invoices are still in draft.
Many times that makes the difference to consider the Sales Order
as closed or not. Because of this, this module introduce two new fields that  will show
that the Sales Order is fully delivered and Fully Invoiced, taking the state into
account.
