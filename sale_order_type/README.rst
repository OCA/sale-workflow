Sales Order Type
================

This module adds a typology for the sales orders. In each different type, you
can define, invoicing and refunding journal, a warehouse, a sequence,
the shipping policy, the invoicing policy, a payment term, a pricelist
and an incoterm.

You can see sale types as lines of business.

You are able to select a sales order type by partner so that when you add a
partner to a sales order it will get the related info to it.

Configuration
=============

To configure Sale Order Types you need to:

#. Go to **Sales > Configuration > Sales Orders Types**
#. Create a new sale order type with all the settings you want

Usage
=====

#. Go to **Sales > Sales Orders** and create a new sale order. Select the new
   type you have created before and all settings will be propagated.
#. You can also define a type for a particular partner if you go to *Sales &
   Purchases* and set a sale order type.
