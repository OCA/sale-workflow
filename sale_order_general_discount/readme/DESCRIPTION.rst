This module allows to set a general discount in a sales order. This general
discount is set to each line order in the standard `discount` field.

You can also set a default general discount on customers.

By default, all products are included, but you can set a domain in the settings
so that only sale order lines of certain products are discounted according to
the general discount rate of the order in its entirety.
