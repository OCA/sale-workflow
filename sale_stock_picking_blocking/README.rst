This module extends the functionality of sales to allow you to block the
creation of deliveries from a sales order and give a reason.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to 'Sales > Configuration > Sales Orders > Delivery Block Reason'.
2. Create the different reasons that can lead to block the deliveries of
   a sales order.
3. Add some users to the group 'Release Delivery Block in Sales Orders'.

Additionally, you can set a customer with a 'Default Delivery Block
Reason' policy to add that delivery block to his sales by default:

1. Go to 'Sales > Sales > Customers'.
2. In the 'Sales & Purchases' add a 'Default Delivery Block Reason'.
3. The 'Default Delivery Block Reason' will be added automatically when
   creating a new sales order for the customer.

You can also set a payment term with a 'Default Delivery Block Reason'
policy to add that delivery block to his sales by default (only if the
customer does not have one set), in a similar way to the customers:

#. Go to 'Invoicing > Configuration > Invoicing > Payment Terms'. #. Add
a 'Default Delivery Block Reason'. #. The 'Default Delivery Block
Reason' will be added automatically when creating a new sales order for
the payment term, in case the customer does not have one.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Create a new sales order and provide a 'Delivery Block Reason'.
2. Confirm Sale (No delivery would be created).
3. Release Delivery Block when it is time to create the deliveries for
   the sales order.
