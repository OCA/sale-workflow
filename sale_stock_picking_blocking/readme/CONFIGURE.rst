To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to 'Sales > Configuration > Sales > Delivery Block Reason'.
#. Create the different reasons that can lead to block the deliveries of a
   sales order.
#. Add some users to the group 'Release Delivery Block in Sales Orders'.

Additionally, you can set a customer with a 'Default Delivery Block Reason'
policy to add that delivery block to his sales by default:

#. Go to 'Sales > Sales > Customers'.
#. In the 'Sales & Purchases' add a 'Default Delivery Block Reason'.
#. The 'Default Delivery Block Reason' will be added
   automatically when creating a new sales order for the customer.
