This module adds a new "Sale" group called "User: Team documents", that
includes the proper permissions for showing only the information related to
that user sale team (having assigned that team/channel or no team at all,
independently from the assigned salesman):

* Contacts.
* Quotations/Sales Orders (implemented in sales_team_security_sale)
* Leads/Opportunities (implemented in sales_team_security_crm)

It also handles the propagation of the sales team from commercial partners to
the contacts, which standard doesn't do.

It also handles the sync (auto-creation and remove) of followers in company partners
and childs of them according to salesmans. Any example about it:
- Partner company > Salesman: Admin
- Partner company, Contact 1 > Without salesman
- Partner company, Contact 2 > Salesman: Demo
All these partners have these followers: Admin + Demo

And finally, there are rules for partners to be restricted to the own ones for
the group "User: Own Documents Only" for being coherent with the permission
scheme. Someone with this permission will see:

- Contacts without salesman nor team assigned.
- Contacts without salesman assigned, but the same team.
- Contacts with them as salesman, independently from the team.
- Contacts with them as follower.

For keeping consistent accesses, followers of the main and shipping/invoice
contacts are synced according the salesman of the children contacts

#. Open or create a user.
#. On the section "Sale", select "User: Team documents".
