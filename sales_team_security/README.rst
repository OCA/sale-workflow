This module adds a new group called "Channel manager", that includes
the proper permissions for showing only the information related to that
channel (having assigned that channel/team or no channel at all, independently
from the assigned salesman):

* Leads/Opportunities
* Contacts.
* Quotations/Sales Orders

It also handles the propagation of the sales team from commercial partners to
the contacts, which standard doesn't do.

And finally, there are rules for partners to be restricted to the own ones for
the group "User: Own Documents Only" for being coherent with the permission
scheme. Someone with this permission will see:

- Contacts without salesman nor channel assigned.
- Contacts without salesman assigned, but the same channel.
- Contacts with them as salesman, independently from the channel.
- Contacts with them as follower.

   "Sales" part.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module modifies sales security groups hierarchy, so any other module
  doing something similar might conflict with this one.
* Split the module in 2 as now `crm` is independent.
