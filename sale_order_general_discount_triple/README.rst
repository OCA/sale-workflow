Usage
=====

To use features of this module, you need to:

#. Go to Settings > General Settings > Pricing
#. Under pricing section, select your prefered Discount type from 'General Discount' field and
   the same for 'Pricelist Discount'.
#. Option 'No apply' will disable functionality, so this kind of discount type won't be applied on lines.
#. The selected global discount type among the 3 discounts will be automatically parsed on sale order line while using 'Discount %' text field.
#. If pricelist has a discount, it will be applied on the selected pricelist discount.
#. If 'General Discount' and 'Pricelist Discount' have the same discount field, 'General Discount' will be applied.

Issues
======

If you want to use pricelist discount its recomended, in order to avoid conflicts with other modules, to put it in
first discount field.
