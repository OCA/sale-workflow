This module adds functional fields to show sale order in the company currency:
amount total.

1. For tree view, when you have SO in multiple currencies, Odoo sums them up
   regardless the different currencies. This module adds a column & sums in
   the company's currency.

2. The field is also shown in form view after the total.
