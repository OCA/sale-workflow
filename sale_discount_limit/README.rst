Sale Discount Limit
===================

This module was created to extend the sales process. It allows to
set a maximum permitted sales discount % on each product on a sale quotation.

A sales user cannot approve a sales quotation if any of the items contain a
sales discount % above the maximum allowed.

A user can manually initiate the maximum discount limit check when the quote
is in status draft or sent.

Users belonging to the group 'Sales Quotation Discount Block Releaser' will
have the permission to override this rule and approve the sales quotation.
