#. Go to ** Settings > Technical > Sub State Configuration ** and Add  "Base Substate".
    If necessary you can add "Target State values" (ex define a substate for "cancel"
    state).
    Substate sequence is very important.
#. Create a sale order and check if the substate are displayed on the header of
   form view. Check if you can't set substate defined for sale if sate is a quotation.
