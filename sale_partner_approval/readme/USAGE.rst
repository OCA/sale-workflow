To approve a Partner to be used in sales:

* Edit the Partner form, and in the "Sales & Purchase" tab check the "Candidate to Sell" box.
* Make sure the Parter is in a Stage that has the "Approved for Sales" checkbox enabled.
  If this is the case, the Partner will automatically have enabled the "Can Sell To" checkbox.
  found next to the "Candidate to Sell" checkbox.

The "Candidate to Sell" checkbox is only available in a draft/to approve Stage.
The "Can Sell To" will only be set when moving to a Stage that is not draft/to approve.
Moving from an approved Stage to a draft one will not automatically reset the "Can Sell To".
This means that removing from Can Sale state also needs to go through an approval.

On a Sales Order:

* The "Customer" and "Invoice Address" selection lists
  only propose partners you "Can Sell To".
* The CONFIRM button will show a blocking exception message if the selected Customeror
  Invoice Address do not have the "Can Sell To" flag checked (this may vary depending
  how the exception rules are configured).
