* Sale Quotation:

  * Sale process in draft stage just informing prices and element of communication.

* Sale Order:

  * Sale process confirmed, the customer already have a compromise with us in terms of pay an invoice and receive our product or service.

Originally Odoo manage only 1 sequence for this 2 documents, then the sales order won and lost manage the same sequence losing
almost all lost quotations in terms of sequences, making so difficult understand with a quick view if we are good or bad in terms of
logistic and sale process already confirmed.


**Technical Explanation**

When you create a quotation, it is numbered using the 'sale.quotation'
sequence.  When you confirm a quotation, its orginal number is saved in the
'origin' field and the sale order gets a new number, retrieving it from
'sale.order' sequence.

* With Odoo Base:

    Sale Quotation 1 Number = SO001

    Sale Quotation 2 Number = SO002

    Sale Quotation 3 Number = SO003

    Sale Quotation 4 Number = SO004

* With Odoo + This Module:

    Sale Quotation 1 Number = SQ001

    Sale Quotation 2 Number = SQ002

    Sale Quotation 3 Number = SQ003

    Sale Quotation 4 Number = SQ004

    Sale Quotation 2 Confirmed = Number for Sale Order SO001 from Sale Quotation SQ002

    Sale Quotation 1 Confirmed = Number for Sale Order SO002 from Sale Quotation SQ001

    Sale Quotation 4 Confirmed = Number for Sale Order SO003 from Sale Quotation SQ004
