On Sales Orders, click on the "New Revision" button.
This creates a new revision of the quotation,
with the same base number and a revision number appended.

A message is added in the chatter saying that a new
revision was created.

The linked Invoices are re-linked from the previous revision to the new one.

In the form view, a new tab is added that lists the previous revisions, with
the date they were made obsolete and the user who performed the action.

The old revisions of a sale order are flagged as inactive, so they don't
clutter up searches.
