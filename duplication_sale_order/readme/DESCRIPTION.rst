This module provides a wizard that facilitates the duplication of sales with a
certain recurrence.

User defines a begin date and recurrence (week, monthly) and the wizard creates
draft quotations with the dates selected in the wizard

It's useful for users who regularly sell the same products to the same customer,
such as bakers who receive the same orders from shops every week.
