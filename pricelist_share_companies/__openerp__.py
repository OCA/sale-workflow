    '''
In OpenERP, product prices (cost, list) are expressed in the currency of
the price_type (by default the same than your company currency).

The idea here is to have the same products between compagnies (with each one
their own currency through different price_type and different costs) but
only one pricelist for all. For that purpose, we add a company_id on price_type
object and a rule to separate them for each company. This way,
the price computation of pricelist will take the right price_type currency as
based price.

Concretely, to have a different cost price for a second company, you have to :
 - Create a new standard price on product.template
 - Create a new 'Price Type' on this new field, with the desired currency and
   assigned to the new currency
 - Assign the existing 'Cost Price' to your main company
 - On the setup of each company, in the 'Configuration''s Tab, select
   the product field used for the cost

The Price Type used is the first one found for the cost field configured on
the company. To ensure the right Price Type
is selected, you have to put the company on the Price Types, and according to
the security rule created, you will have access
only to the right Price Type.

Example:

I create a product A. it has 2 fields for cost prices : Cost Price and
Cost Price CH

Price type Sale company A : Cost Price / EUR
Price type Sale company B : Cost Price CH / CHF

Cost Price of Product A, company A: 60
Cost Price CH of Product A, company B: 70

Product A in company A: The cost price is 60 * currency rate
Product A in company B: The cost price is 70 * currency rate
