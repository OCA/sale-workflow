This module allows to define min, max and multiple order quantity on product.
Min and Max order quantity is either required or recommended.
If you check "Force Min/Max Qty" on product the Min/Max Qty do not block sale
order.
This can be used if the available stock is less than the Min Qty
or if you want to sell sample products.
Max Qty can be used if we don't want to sale more than available qty
(end of series product)

Settings are defined on product, if values are not set we use settings from
product template.
If settings are not set on product template we use settings from
product category otherwise parent category.
