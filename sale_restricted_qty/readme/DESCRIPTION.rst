This module allows to define minimum and multiple order quantity on product.
Minimum order quantity is either required or recommanded.
If you check "Force min Qty" on product the min qty do not block sale
order.
This can be used if the available stock is less then the min qty
or if you want to sell sample products.

Setings are defined on product, if values are not set we use settings from
product template.
If settings are not set on product template we use settings from
product category otherwise parent category.
