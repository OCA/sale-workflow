This module allows to the sale managers to force all the lines to
invoice independently of the invoice policy and the delivered quantities
of the products.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Make a sale order with products with a delivered quantities invoice
   policy.
2. Confirm the order.
3. If you try to invoice the order, you can't as the quantities aren't
   delivered.
4. But if you are a Sales Manager, you have a new button *Force Invoice
   Policy*
5. Once clicked, you can invoice all the lines as if they were already
   delivered.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Modifiying the original demand after the forcing could lead to
   misscalculations.
