This module extends the functionality of sales orders to allow to set an
elaboration on lines that will add an extra order line with an elaboration
product linked to it when the delivery order is validated.

An **elaboration** is a process that needs to be done over the product, usually
on picking/handling phase. It doesn't modify too much the product for needing
an specific product, but it adds a surcharge on the final price.
