This module extends the functionality of sale orders to allow to add an
elaboration in a sale order line and add an extra line with an elaboration
product linked to the elaboration.
An elaboration is a process that needs to be done over the product, usually on
picking/handling phase. It doesn't modify too much the product for needing an
specific product, but it adds a surcharge on the final price.
