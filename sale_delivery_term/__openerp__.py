Delivery term for sale orders.
You can configure delivery terms specifying the quantity percentage and the
delay for every term line.
You can then associate the term to the 'main' order line and generate
the 'detailed' order lines which in turn will generate several pickings
according to delivery term (thanks to 'sale_multi_picking' module).
