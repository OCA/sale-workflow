To use this module, you need to:

* Define a *product set* as sale manager:
    - choose products
    - for each products, define a quantity.
    - for each products (if Discounts setting is active), define a discount or leave default value
    - Sort *set* lines, this order will be the default when added into the
      quotation

* Then you can remove or update added lines as any other sale order lines.
