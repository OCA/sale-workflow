Sale Product set
================

A **product set** is a list of products which end customers aren't aware, this
list is defined by sales manager.

This module aims to help salesman to quickly create several sale order lines
at once in a quotation.

After a *product set* is added to the sale order, each line can be update or
remove as any other sale order lines.

This is differ to packing products as you don't follow *product set* after it
was added to the sale order.
