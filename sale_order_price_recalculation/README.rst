Recalculation of sales order lines prices on demand
===================================================

This module add 2 buttons on sale orders (below sale order lines) that:

* Recalculates the prices of the order lines that contain a product in them.
* Reset product descriptions from current product information.

It is launched manually as a button to get the user decide if he/she wants to
recalculate prices when pricelist is changed or after duplicating a sale order
to update or not sales information.

Usage
=====

Inside a sale order, you can click on "Recalculate prices" to launch a
recalculation of all the prices of the lines, losing previous custom prices.

The second "Reset descriptions" will get descriptions from products, losing
custom descriptions.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* In a sale order with lot of lines, the recalculation may slow down, because
  sale general data (amount untaxed, amount taxed...) are recalculated for
  each line.
