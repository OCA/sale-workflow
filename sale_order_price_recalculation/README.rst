This module adds a button on sale orders below pricelist that recalculates the
prices of the order lines that contain a product in them.

It is launched manually as a button to get the user decide if he/she wants to
recalculate prices when pricelist is changed.

Usage
=====

Inside a sale order, you can click in any moment a button called
"(Recalculate prices)", that is next to the pricelist selection, to launch
a recalculation of all the prices of the lines, losing previous custom prices.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* In a sale order with lot of lines, the recalculation may slow down, because
  sale general data (amount untaxed, amount taxed...) are recalculated for
  each line.
