1. Add a custom text field to Sales Order Line
2. Create an Attributes with Variants Creation Mode set to "Never"
3. In the Attribute, set the "Store In Field" with the custom text field created
4. Optionally, on the Attribute Values, set a specific "Store In Field Value"
   to use instead of the actual Attribute Value name.
   In particular this can be used to set Boolean values,
   where "0" or "False" sets a falsy value.
