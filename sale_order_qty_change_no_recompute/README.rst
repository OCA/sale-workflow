A lot of business don't set different prices according the quantity of
the product to sell, and they see very annoying to set a manual price
after the negotiation with the customer, and see it changed when they
vary the demanded quantity.

This module prevents this avoiding the recomputation of the price unit,
discount and pricelist item fields if only the quantity has been changed
in the sales order line.
