This module creates RFQs based on a vendor price list. To check if a product has vendors
defined:

- Open the product for which you want to create a request for quotation.

- Check that at least one supplier is added in the "Purchase" tab.

To use the built-in "Alternatives" feature for a created RFQ:

- Go to Purchase/Configuration/Settings and in the Orders section check the box next to
  Purchase Agreements.
