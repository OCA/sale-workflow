This module allows you to create RFQs directly from sales quotation.
Requests for quotations will be created for all suppliers who are
capable of supplying products of the sales quotation.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Sometimes you need get purchase prices from suppliers before you can
confirm a sales order. You may have multiple suppliers, so you would
like query all those who are capable of delivering the requested
products.

Configuration
=============

This module creates RFQs based on a vendor price list. To check if a
product has vendors defined:

-  Open the product for which you want to create a request for
   quotation.

-  Check that at least one supplier is added in the "Purchase" tab.

To use the built-in "Alternatives" feature for a created RFQ:

-  Go to Purchase/Configuration/Settings and in the Orders section check
   the box next to Purchase Agreements.

Usage
=====

Click the "Create RFQ" button in the proposal form. New RFQs will be
created and you will be redirected to the RFQ list.

For each quotation an RFQ line will be created for each applicable
supplier.

If there are multiple products that supplier can deliver all such
products will be grouped in one RFQ.

A vendor pricelist matches if:

-  Product variant in the quotation line corresponds to the product
   variant in the vendor price list AND the quantity in the quotation
   line is not less than the minimum quantity in the vendor price list

OR

-  Product variant in the quotation line corresponds to the product in
   the vendor price list AND the quantity in the quotation line is not
   less than the minimum quantity in the vendor price list

Example:

-  Vendor A has a price list for the product "T-shirt" with minimum
   quantity 10

-  Vendor B has a price list for the product variant "T-shirt color:
   red" with minimum quantity 20

-  Vendor C has a price list for the product variant "T-shirt Color of
   shirt: blue" with minimum quantity 15

-  Vendor D has a price list for the product variant "T-shirt color:
   red" with minimum quantity 50

A quotation has the following line: "T-shirt color: red" quantity: 30

RFQs will be created for the following vendors:

-  Vendor A, because the product variant in the quotation line matches
   the product AND minimum quantity in the price list

-  Vendor B, because the product variant in the quotation line matches
   to the product variant AND minimum quantity in the price list

RFQs will NOT be generated for the following vendors:

-  Vendor C, because the product variant in the quotation line does not
   match the product variant in the price list

-  Vendor D, because the quantity in the quotation line is less than the
   minimum quantity in the price list

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Check if RFQs already created/exist upon click the Create RFQ button

-  Select preferred supplier only before create RFQs, i.e. a capable
   vendor list pop up window upon click the Create RFQ button.
