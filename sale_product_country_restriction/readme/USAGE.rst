Go to Sales > Configuration > Product Restrictions

There, you can configure restrictions for countries and/or country groups (see
product_country_restriction module for usage).

Create a sale order. If you set a partner for shipping that
corresponds to one embargo rule, a warning will be launched when you choose
a product that fullfills one rule.

Moreover, you won't be allowed to confirm that sale order.

Installing this module will set the country and country restriction on partner
mandatory before sale order confirmation.
