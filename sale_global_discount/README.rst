Configuration
=============

To configure this module please refer to configure section of the `base_global_discount` module.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. See usage section of the `base_global_discount` module.
#. Create a new sale order and choose a partner.
#. If the partner has customer global discounts set, those will be applied to
   the order by default.
#. Otherwise, you can set them manually from the header of the sale order.
#. In the order footer, you can see the computed discounts.
#. When you create an invoice from the order, the proper global discounts will
   be applied on it.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Not all the taxes combination can be compatible with global discounts. An
  error is raised in that cases.
* Currently, taxes in invoice lines are mandatory with global discounts.
