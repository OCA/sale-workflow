Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Parameters > Global Discounts*
#. Add a new discount.
#. Choose the discount scope (sales or purchases).
#. You can also restrict it to a certain company if needed.

You can assign global discounts to partners as well:

#. Go to a partner that is a company.
#. Go to the *Sales & Purchases* tab.
#. In section sale (if the partner is a customer), you can set sale discounts.
#. In section purchase (if the partner is a supplier), you can set purchase
   discounts.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Create a new sale order and choose a partner.
#. If the partner has customer global discounts set, those will be applied to
   the order by default.
#. Otherwise, you can set them manually from the header of the sale order.
#. In the order footer, you can see the computed discounts.
#. When you create an invoice from the order, the proper global discounts will
   be applied on it.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Not all the taxes combination can be compatible with global discounts. An
  error is raised in that cases.
* Currently, taxes in invoice lines are mandatory with global discounts.
