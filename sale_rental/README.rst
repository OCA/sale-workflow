**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

In the menu *Sales > Products > Product Variants*, on the form view of a stockable product or consumable, in the *Rental* tab, there is a button *Create Rental Service* which starts a wizard to generate the corresponding rental service.

In the menu *Warehouse > Configuration > Warehouses*, on the form view of the warehouse, in the *Technical Information* tab, you will see two additional stock locations: *Rental In* (stock of products to rent) and *Rental Out* (products currently rented). In the *Warehouse Configuration* tab, make sure that the option *Rental Allowed* is checked.

To use the module, you need to have access to the form view of sale order lines. For that, you must add your user to one of these groups:

* Manage Product Packaging
* Properties on lines

Upon module installation, all users are automatically added to the group *Manage Product Packaging*.

Usage
=====

In a sale order line (form view, not tree view), if you select a rental service, you can :

* create a new rental with a start date and an end date: when the sale order is confirmed, it will generate a delivery order and an incoming shipment.
* extend an existing rental: the incoming shipment will be postponed to the end date of the extension.

In a sale order line, if you select a product that has a corresponding rental service, you can decide to sell the rented product that the customer already has. If the sale order is confirmed, the incoming shipment will be cancelled and a new delivery order will be created with a stock move from *Rental Out* to *Customers*.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module has the following limitations:

* No support for planning/agenda of the rented products
* The unit of measure of the rental services must be *Day* (the rental per hours / per week / per month is not supported for the moment)
* In case of selling rented product, the incoming shipment should be created manually
