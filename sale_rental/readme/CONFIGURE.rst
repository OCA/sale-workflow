In the *Products* menu, on the form view of a stockable product or consumable, in the *Sales* tab, there is a button *Create Rental Service* which starts a wizard to generate the corresponding rental service.

In the menu *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Warehouses*, on the form view of the warehouse, in the *Technical Information* tab, you will see two additional stock locations: *Rental In* (stock of products to rent) and *Rental Out* (products currently rented). In the *Warehouse Configuration* tab, make sure that the option *Rental Allowed* is checked.
