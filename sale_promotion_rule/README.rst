This module adds the concept of promotion rules that can be applied on the sale
order.

Two kinds of rules are implemented:
 * automatic
 * coupon

Automatic rules are applied/recomputed automatically for a sale order when the
user clicks on the button "Apply discount" in the view form. Depending on the
rule's criteria more than one automatic rule can be applied to a same sale
order.

Coupon are special manual rules. Only one coupon can be applied to a
sale order. This rule takes always precedence over automatic rules.
