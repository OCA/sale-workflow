#. Go to 'Sales / Sales / Sales Orders'.
#. Select or click in a sale order.
#. Go to 'Action' and click 'Invoice Order' or press the button 'Invoice
   Order' if you are inside a sale order. The result, in case there are draft
   invoices that correspond to this one, is an existing draft invoice with
   the new lines added.
   In the wizard, if the user belongs to the group 'Change sale to invoice merge
   proposal', the option to deactivate the 'Merge with draft invoices' is
   given. In this case, the result is a new draft invoice is created
   following the usual behaviour.

Create Invoices from a group of Sales Orders:

#. Go to 'Sales / Sales / Sales Orders'.
#. Select all the sales orders with status 'To invoice'.
#. Go to 'Action' and click 'Invoice Order'. As a result, new draft invoices
   will be merged with existing ones when corresponding.
   In the wizard, if the user belongs to the group 'Change sale to invoice merge
   proposal', the option to deactivate the 'Merge with draft invoices' is
   given. In this case, the result is a new draft invoice for every sale
   order following the usual behaviour.
