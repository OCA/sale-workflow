This module adds a scheduled action that automatically cancels quotations after their expiration date.

A company setting can be modified to decide how many days after the expiration date the quotations are automatically cancelled.

Configuration
=============

Go to the menu *Sale > Configuration > Settings*, in the section *Quotations & Sales*, set the *Auto-cancel expired quotations after* in days.

Usage
=====

By default, the scheduled action *Cancel Expired Quotations* is not enabled in order to
first configure the setting parameter for the number of days.

Once enabled, the scheduled action will run automatically once a day.
