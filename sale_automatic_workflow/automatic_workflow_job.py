#Some comment about the implementation
#In order to validate the invoice the picking we have to use schedule action
#Indeed, if we directly jump the various step in the workflow of the invoice and the picking
#the sale order workflow will be broken
#The explication is "simple"
#Example with the invoice workflow
#When we are in the sale order at the step router
#a transiotion like a signal or condition will change the step of the workflow to the step 'invoice'
#the fact to enter in this step will launch the creation of the invoice
#if the invoice in directly validated and reconcilled with the payment
#the subworkflow will end and send a signal to the sale order workflow
#the problem is that the sale order workflow have not finish to apply the step invoice
#and so the signal of the subworkflow will be lost
#because the step invoice is still not finish
#The step invoice should be finish before receiving the signal
#this is meant that we can not directly validated every step of the workflow invoice_amount
#it the same with the picking workflow_method

#If my explication is not clear contact me by email and I will imporve it: sebastien.beau@akretion.com
