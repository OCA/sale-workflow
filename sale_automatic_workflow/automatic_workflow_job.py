Some comments about the implementation

In order to validate the invoice and the picking, we have to use
scheduled actions, because if we directly jump the various steps in the
workflow of the invoice and the picking, the sale order workflow will be
broken.

The explanation is 'simple'. Example with the invoice workflow: When we
are in the sale order at the workflow router, a transition like a signal
or condition will change the step of the workflow to the step 'invoice';
this step will launch the creation of the invoice.  If the invoice is
directly validated and reconciled with the payment, the subworkflow will
end and send a signal to the sale order workflow.  The problem is that
the sale order workflow has not yet finished to apply the step 'invoice',
so the signal of the subworkflow will be lost because the step 'invoice'
is still not finished. The step invoice should be finished before
receiving the signal. This means that we can not directly validate every
steps of the workflow in the same transaction.

If my explanation is not clear, contact me by email and I will improve
it: sebastien.beau@akretion.com
