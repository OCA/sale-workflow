Glue module between `sale_by_packaging` and `sale_product_set_packaging_qty`.

a warning is displayed in the product form and quick link to all involved lines allows to review them.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
