=================
Sale Credit Point
=================

Sale based on partners' credit point.

Use case
--------

You have employees that have some credit (up to you where this come from)
and you allow employees to buy products based on this credit.

Products are sold by points rather than money.


Features and usage
------------------

Partner model has a new field `credit_point` which can be updated easily
via a smart button on the partner form. Smart button displays
`current points / sum of all points increases this year`.

A new currency is created `PT` (points) and is used by default
for `credit_point` field.

On order confirmation the amount of the order
is compared with partner's credit:

   a. credit is not enough on partner -> the order cannot be confirmed
   b. no credit is left on partner
      but the user is member of `Manage credit point` -> order can be confirmed
   c. no credit is left on partner
      but the context has key `skip_credit_check` -> order can be confirmed

If the order is confirmed the credit is deducted from partner.

History of all credit point allocations can be looked up
in `sales -> configuration -> credit point history`.
