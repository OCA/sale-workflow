Classify products according to their sales and seasonality.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Configuration > Settings* and *Product Catalog* group.
#. There you can configure the sales amount ranges that a product has to acomplish to
   be consider in each sales classification group.
#. By default, a period of 365 days will be evaluated, but it can be set here as
   well.
#. We can also set a minimum product life in the *Sales classification days to ignore*
   setting.

A cron is available to schedule the classification evaluation periodically. Go to
*Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions* and set the *Classify products
by sales* cron to your preferred settings.

Usage
=====

If you want to configure your products by hand, you can go to any of them and set
the **Sale Classification** and **Seasonality Classification** on hand.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Seasonality has to be set by hand, but it would be nice to have it computed as well.
* An option for v13 could be merging the sales classification method with the module
  `product_abc_classification` that is based on delivered quantities and a more complex
  rule set design. In the moment of this PR, the module is still in development
  (https://github.com/OCA/product-attribute/pull/623) and even a divergent backport
  is beign made (https://github.com/OCA/product-attribute/pull/781).
  So this is a tinier and simpler approach with different metrics that can be merged
  into the logic of the more generic a broad `product_abc_classification`.
