This module injects a button in the sale confirmation email with a portal link
that the customer can follow in order to sign, pay or just review the order like
it used to be in <v11.

Usage
=====

Whenever the *Sales Order: Send by email* is sent, a button with the portal
link will be sent.

If the order is to be payed or signed, the text of the button will ask to do so.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The button template is hardcoded, so styling will be quite limited (we should
  monkeypatch the method and translations in a custom module). Maybe an optional
  solution could be making a generic mako injector, with an extra html field in
  the template that we'd inject if set and an extra module for sale with the
  data already prepared for the sale template.
