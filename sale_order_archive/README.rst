On a system with a high volume of sales, the number of sale orders displayed in the list view can become huge.
This module allows to archive Sale Orders that are in status Locked or Cancelled.

If a sale order is archived, it will be hidden from the sale orders list view.

This module only depends on module sale, but it could be used in combination with OCA module 'record_archiver' in order
to automatically archive old sale orders.
