  In order to test stock sale exception we have to ensure that
  if a sale order that can not be delivired on time it should not be confirmed.
  We have also to test that even if our sale order can be delivered
  it should not break any already placed SO,
-
  For testing purpose I deactivate all sale exception(s) that could interfer
-
  !python {model: sale.exception}: |
    ids_to_keep = [ref("no_stock_at_date"), ref("no_stock_in_future")]
    ids_to_silent = self.search(cr, uid, [('id', 'not in', ids_to_keep)])
    data = {}
    data['active'] = False
    self.write(cr, uid, ids_to_silent, data)
