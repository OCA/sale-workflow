This module brings the possibility to indicate if a task is available to be
invoiced or not, within the task itself. Moreover, even if the task is not
finished yet, it can be set as invoiceable.

As an option, you can relate this control to a Project Stage
( ``project.task.type`` ). For example, if you want to assign 'Invoiceable' to
``Done`` stage always.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to **Sales > Products > Products** and create a **service** product.

2. Within the product, choose your preferences under **General Information**
   tab, as follows:

   * From **Create on Order** select *Task* or *Project & Task*.
   * Tick off **Invoicing control by task** checkbox, and save.

3. Go to **Sales > Orders > Orders** and create a new one. Add a customer and
   the product you have created.

4. Confirm the sales order. It will create a new task on your selected project.

5. Go to the task and you will find a smartbutton named *Not invoiceable*. When
   you click on it, you will indicate that the task can be invoiced.

   If the product is configured with an invoicing policy "Timesheets on tasks",
   time spent on the task is used to compute the delivered quantity.

6. Optional: if you want to use project stages to control this, go to
   **Project > Configuration > Task Stages**, and in the stages that you
   consider are invoiceable, you have to set the *Invoiceable* field to true.
