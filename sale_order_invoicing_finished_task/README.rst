==================================
Sale Order Invoicing Finished Task
==================================

The requirement of this module is to give the possibility in the task to
indicate if a task is available to invoice or not. This means by default even
the task is not finished you could set it as invoiceable.

As an option you can relate to a Project Stage ( ``project.task.type`` ) this
control. For example if you want to assign Invoiceable to stage ``Done`` always.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Sales -> Product and create a service product

2. In the product go to Invoicing tab and select (1) An invocing policy (2)
   Track service must be create a task and tack hours (3) Set Invoicing
   finished task checkbox and save

3. Go to Sales -> Sale orders -> Create a new one. Add a customer y the product
   you have created
4. Confirm the sales order, it will create you a project and a task
5. Go to the task and you will find a smartbutton called Not invoiceable, when
   you press the button you will indicate that the task can be invoiced

   If the product is configured with an invoicing policy = Order, then the
   delivered quantity is set to the ordered quantity. Otherwise, the time spent
   on the task is used.

6. Optional: if you want to use project stages to control this Go To
   Project -> Settings -> Stage -> You have to set true the field Invoiceable
   in the stages that you consider are invoiceable. Event to use stages for
   this functionality you can also set it manually in the task whenever you
   want.
