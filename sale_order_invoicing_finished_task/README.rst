The requirement of this module is to give the possibility in the task to
indicate if a task is available to invoice or not. This means by default even
the task is not finished you could set it as invoiceable.

As an option you can relate to a Project Stage ( ``project.task.type`` ) this
control. For example if you want to assign Invoiceable to stage ``Done`` always.

   If the product is configured with an invoicing policy = Order, then the
   delivered quantity is set to the ordered quantity. Otherwise, the time spent
   on the task is used.

6. Optional: if you want to use project stages to control this Go To
   Project -> Configuration -> Stages -> You have to set true the field
   Invoiceable in the stages that you consider are invoiceable. Event to use
   stages for this functionality you can also set it manually in the task
   whenever you want.
