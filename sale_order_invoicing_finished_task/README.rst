The requirement of this module is to give the possibility in the task to
indicate if a task is available to invoice or not. This means by default even
the task is not finished you could set it as invoiceable.

As an option you can relate to a Project Stage ( ``project.task.type`` ) this
control. For example if you want to assign Invoiceable to stage ``Done`` always.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to **Sales -> Product** and create a **service** product

2. In the product go to **Sales tab > Invoicing section** and:
   * Select a *Service Invoicing Policy*
   * *Service Tracking* must be "Create a task in an existing project". You will need to select in which project the task will be created.
   * Set *Invoicing control by task* checkbox and save

3. Go to **Sales -> Sale orders** and create a new one. Add a customer and the
   product you have created
4. Confirm the sales order, it will create you a task in the selected project.
5. Go to the task and you will find a smartbutton called Not invoiceable, when
   you press the button you will indicate that the task can be invoiced

   If the product is configured with an invoicing policy "Timesheets on tasks", then the
   the time spent on the task is used to compute the delivered quantity.

6. Optional: if you want to use project stages to control this Go To
   Project -> Configuration -> Stages -> You have to set true the field
   Invoiceable in the stages that you consider are invoiceable. Event to use
   stages for this functionality you can also set it manually in the task
   whenever you want.
