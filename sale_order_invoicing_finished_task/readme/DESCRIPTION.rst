The requirement of this module is to give the possibility in the task to
indicate if a task is available to invoice or not. This means by default even
the task is not finished you could set it as invoiceable.

As an option you can relate to a Project Stage ( ``project.task.type`` ) this
control. For example if you want to assign Invoiceable to stage ``Done`` always.
