This module adds a field on the Sales & Purchases tab of the partner form where
you can register the default incoterms for new sales orders for this customer.

The field is only visible for customers (company partners and contacts) and user
which have appropriate group 'Display incoterms on Sales Order and related
invoices'. A different incoterm can be set per contact within the same company.

When the partner is selected on a new quotation, the incoterm is retrieved from
the partner record.
