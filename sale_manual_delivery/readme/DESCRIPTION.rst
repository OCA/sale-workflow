The goal of this module is to allow the manual creation of delivery slips. If activated,
a sale order won't directly impact the stock. It will not make a reservation on the stock.
It allows the delivery and the impact on stock to be done manually when needed.
The goal is to be used on long term projects where not all the material is shipped at once.
As you make many shipments, every time you make a new delivery, you can choose an new carrier as well
as a planned date. A wizard helps you to chose what to deliver by showing you how much you already
planned to ship.
