This module adds the manufacturing related settings to products and the
product states then control whether or not the product can be
manufactured, a component of a manufacturing order or on a bom in the
particular state.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

-  The product states are configured to allow/block workflows for the
   manufacturing processes.
-  The product is configured via check boxes.
-  The 'Can be' check boxes are readonly and controlled by the state
   configuration boxes and set accordingly based on the product state
   settings.

Usage
=====

-  A User will not be able to manually add a product that is not in an
   approved state for manufacturing to the MO. If a product is moved to
   a state where the 'Approved to be Manufactured' is not set, then the
   manufacturing order will show an exception: Same for if a product is
   moved to a state where the 'Approved to be a Component on a
   Manufacturing Order' is not set, then the manufacturing order will
   show an exception In both of the above cases, if a user tries clicks
   either the 'Confirm' or 'Mark as Done' buttons, then a warning shows
   informing the user that there is an exception.
-  For Work Orders on a Manufacturing Order which has an exception, if
   the user clicks either the 'Start' or 'Done' buttons, a warning shows
   information the user that there is an exception on the manufacturing
   order.
-  For Bill of Materials, same logic applies as above so if a product
   that is on a BoM. If an existing product on a BoM is moved to a
   non-approved state then the BoM will show the exceptions. A User will
   not be able to manually add a product that is not in an approved
   state for manufacturing to the BoM.
