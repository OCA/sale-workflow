- A User will not be able to manually add a product that is not in an
  approved state for manufacturing to the MO. If a product is moved to a
  state where the 'Approved to be Manufactured' is not set, then the
  manufacturing order will show an exception: Same for if a product is
  moved to a state where the 'Approved to be a Component on a
  Manufacturing Order' is not set, then the manufacturing order will
  show an exception In both of the above cases, if a user tries clicks
  either the 'Confirm' or 'Mark as Done' buttons, then a warning shows
  informing the user that there is an exception.
- For Work Orders on a Manufacturing Order which has an exception, if
  the user clicks either the 'Start' or 'Done' buttons, a warning shows
  information the user that there is an exception on the manufacturing
  order.
- For Bill of Materials, same logic applies as above so if a product
  that is on a BoM. If an existing product on a BoM is moved to a
  non-approved state then the BoM will show the exceptions. A User will
  not be able to manually add a product that is not in an approved state
  for manufacturing to the BoM.
