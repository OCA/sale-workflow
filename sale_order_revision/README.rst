Revisions for sale orders (and quotations)
==========================================

On canceled orders, you can click on 'new revision' and the 'old revisions'
tab of the just created request for quotation will contain all the old
(canceled orders) revisions.
So that you can track every change you made to your requests for quotation and
sale orders.
