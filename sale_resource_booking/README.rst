This module extends the functionality of sale and resource bookings to support
creating pending resource bookings automatically when confirming a sale order
and to allow you to generate those sale orders easily from a resource booking
type.

Installation
============

To have a nice UI to manage quotations and sales orders, install
``sale_management``. However, this is not strictly required.

Configuration
=============

To enjoy all features from this module, you need these permissions:

* Sales / User: Own Documents Only
* Resource Booking / User

Usage
=====

To quote one resource booking quickly, you need to:

#. Go to *Resource bookings > Types* and pick one.
#. Click *Quote*.
#. Fill the values from that wizard.
#. Click on *Generate quotation*.

In the wizard, one of the things you need to indicate is the product. With this
module, products can be linked to resource booking types (and, optionally,
combinations). When such product is sold and the sale order is confirmed, a new
booking is created automatically (in pending state).

If you need to pre-create those pending bookings when the quotation is not yet
confirmed, you can also do that with the *Sync bookings* button in the
quotation form.

A booking can only be confirmed if its sale order is confirmed, when there is
one.

To create one of such products:

#. Install ``sale_management``.
#. Go to *Sales > Products > Products*.
#. Create one.
#. Go to the *Sales* tab.
#. Under *Resource Bookings*, select one *Booking type*.
#. Optionally, select a *Resource combination* to be assigned by default.

When you confirm a quotation that includes some products related to resource
booking types, you will see a wizard that will help you update quickly those
bookings' values, and invite requesters to schedule them. If you skip it, you
can do it later with the bookings just created.
