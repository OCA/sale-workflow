This module adds a recommended products wizard to current sale order.

It is based on recent delivered products, and allows the salesman to quickly
know the most sold products for current customer, which results in an easy to
use hint to improve sale.

If you want a better mobile usability, the module is ready to use with the
'web_widget_numeric_step' module. Just install it and you will get a better
numeric input experience.
