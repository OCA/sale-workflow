This module adds a concept of primeship for partners.
A primeship is basically a simple membership very easy to use.
This primeship is activated on the confirmation of a sale containing
a primeship activation product for a customizable duration expressed in months.
It is automatically deactivated when the duration expires.
You can then check if the primeship is active for a particular customer 
and take actions based on it.
