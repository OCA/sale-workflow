Once the addon 'sale_discount_display_amount' is installed, the total wihout
discount ant the value of the discount is displayed on the sale orders. These
amounts are computed from the rate of the discount applied on each sale order
line.
Nevertheless, once you use the 'sale_promotion_rule' a discount amount
can be applied on a sale order. This new kind of discount is materialized by a
new line automatically to the sale order line with a specific product and a
negative amount.
The goal of this addon is to also take into account this kind of discount into
the total without discount and the value of the discount on the sale order.
