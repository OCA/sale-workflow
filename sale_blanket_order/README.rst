A blanket order is a pre-agreement to sell a certain number of quantities of
products at a specific price. From a confirmed blanket order, the users can
create new sale orders at such price, until the blanket order expires, either
due to reaching the validity date or exhausting all the quantities of products.

Usage
=====

A new menu in the Sales area is created, allowing users to create new blanket orders.

To create a new Sale Blanket Order go to the sale menu in the Sales section:

    :alt: Blanket Orders menu

Hitting the button create will open the form view in which we can introduce the following
information:

* Vendor
* Salesperson
* Payment Terms
* Validity date
* Order lines:
    * Product
    * Accorded price
    * Original, Ordered, Invoiced, Received and Remaining quantities
* Terms and Conditions of the Blanket Order

From the form, once the Blanket Order has been confirmed and its state is open, the user can
create a Sale Order, check the Sale Orders associated to the Blanket Order and/or
see the Blanket Order lines associated to the BO.

Hitting the button Create Sale Order will open a wizard that will ask for the amount of each
product in the BO lines for which the Sale Order will be created.

Installing this module will add an additional menu which will show all the blanket order lines
currently defined in the system. From this list the user can create customized Sale Orders
selecting the lines for which the PO (or POs if the customers are different) is (are) created.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/sale-workflow/15.0/sale_blanket_order/static/description/BO_lines.png
    :alt: Blanket Order lines and actions

In the Sale Order form one field is added in the PO lines, the Blanket Order line field. This
field keeps track to which Blanket Order line the PO line is associated. Upon adding a new product
in a newly created Sale Order a blanket order line will be suggested depending on the following
factors:

* Closer Validity date
* Remaining quantity > Quantity introduced in the Sale Order line
