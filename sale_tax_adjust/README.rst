Usage
=====

In a sale order document, the tax and status must be set to draft. The steps are as follows:

#. Click on the Edit button.
#. Click on the pencil icon on tax (on the bottom right corner) and you will be able to edit the amount tax.

Note:

If you want the reset amount tax to their original value,
you can click the `Refresh Tax` button to have the system recalculate to the default value.
