Sale Sourced by Line
====================

This module adds the possibility to source a line of sale order from a specific
warehouse instead of using the warehouse of the sale order.

This will create one procurement group per warehouse set in sale
order lines.

It will only supports routes such as MTO and Drop Shipping.
