- In order to check if the source location of a sale order line still use the location
  of the shop if not specified on the sale order line.
- !record {model: sale.order, id: sale_notsourced_01}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
    note: Invoice after delivery
    order_line:
      - product_id: product.product_product_32
        product_uom_qty: 8
- When I confirm the sale order
- !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: sale_notsourced_01}
- Then a delivery order should have been generated
- !python {model: sale.order}: |
    sale_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_notsourced_01"))
    assert len(sale_order.picking_ids) == 1, (
        "1 delivery order expected, got %d" % len(sale_order.picking_ids))
- And the source location of the stock move should be the one of the sales order's
  warehouse
- !python {model: sale.order, id: sale_notsourced_01}: |
    picking = self.picking_ids[0]
    expected_location = self.warehouse_id.lot_stock_id
    for move in picking.move_lines:
        assert move.location_id == expected_location, (
            "Wrong location_id, expected %s, got %s" %
            (expected_location, move.location_id))
        assert move.procurement_id.rule_id.location_src_id == expected_location, (
            "Wrong location_id in procurement.order, expected %s, got %s" %
            (expected_location, move.procurement_id.rule_id.location_src_id))
