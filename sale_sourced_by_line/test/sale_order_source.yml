- In order to check if the source warehouse of a sale order line becomes the source
  warehouse of the delivery stock move. I create a sale order.
- !record {model: sale.order, id: sale_source_01}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
    note: Invoice after delivery
    order_line:
      - product_id: product.product_product_32
        product_uom_qty: 8
        warehouse_id: stock.stock_warehouse_shop0
- When I confirm the sale order
- !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: sale_source_01}
- Then a delivery order should have been generated
- !python {model: sale.order, id: sale_source_01}: |
    assert len(self.picking_ids) == 1, (
        "1 delivery order expected, got %d" % len(self.picking_ids))
- And the source location of the stock move should be the one of the sale order line
- !python {model: sale.order, id: sale_source_01}: |
    picking = self.picking_ids[0]
    for move in picking.move_lines:
        expected_location = move.warehouse_id.lot_stock_id
        assert move.location_id == expected_location, (
            "Wrong location_id in stock.move, expected %s, got %s" %
            (expected_location, move.location_id))
        assert move.procurement_id.rule_id.location_src_id == expected_location, (
            "Wrong location_id in procurement.order, expected %s, got %s" %
            (expected_location, move.procurement_id.rule_id.location_src_id))
