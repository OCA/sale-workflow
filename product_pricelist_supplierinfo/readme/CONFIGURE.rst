To configure pricelists with the new feature of this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Configuration > Settings* and check
   "Multiple Sales Prices per Product" option and
   "Prices computed from formulas" after that. You must have correct
   permissions and you must install **Sales Management** app (sale) to see
   these settings.
#. Create or edit a Sales Pricelist at *Sales > Catalog > Pricelists*.
#. Add or edit a pricelist item and check "Formula" option in
   "Price Computation" section.
#. You will see the new option "Prices based on supplier info".
#. If you want to bypass the "Min.Quantity" field of the supplier info and
   always select the lowest quantity price, check the option
   "Ignore Supplier Info Min. Quantity".
