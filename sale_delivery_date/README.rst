Cutoff
------

Potpone order preparation by 1 day if it has been validated after
the partner or the warehouse cutoff.

This can be bypassed if commitment date is set.


Warehouse Calendar
------------------

Postpone delivery according to the warehouse calendar, if any.


Partner delivery window
-----------------------

Allows to define scheduling preference for delivery orders on customers,
in order to select possible delivery windows to postpone deliveries to.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

To use this, you have to configure a few things:

- You may configure the cutoff by either:

  - setting the order cutoff preference to `warehouse_cutoff`,
    in order to use the warehouse cutoff.
  - setting the order cutoff preference to `partner_cutoff`,
    in order to use the partner cutoff.

- By default, customer's delivery window is set to `anytime` (default odoo behavior).
  It can also be set to `working days` or `time window`.
  If the latter is chosen, then time windows will have to be configured on the
  customer.

- By default, warehouse working hours aren't taken into account
  when computing the scheduled date. If you want to use this feature, just
  add a calendar on the warehouse, and enable the `apply cutoff` option.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The following modules (available in 13.0) has been merged into this module:
 - sale_warehouse_calendar
 - sale_cutoff_time_delivery
 - sale_partner_delivery_window
 - sale_partner_cutoff_delivery_window

The reason for that is that `sale_warehouse_calendar` overrides have to be
executed between `sale_cutoff_time_delivery` and `sale_partner_delivery_window`,
and there's no other clean way to do that.

However, there's still a few things to deal with:
 - Clean tests
 - Clean code
 - Use TZ where it is not the case
 - Use calendar instead of time windows when delivery preference is `working days`
