This module provides different configuration option to manage packagings on
sale orders.

The creation/update of sale order line will be blocked (by constraints) if the data on the
sale.order.line does not fit with the configuration of the product's packagings.

It's also possible to force the quantity to sell/return during creation/modification of the sale order line
if the "Force sale quantity" is ticked on the packaging and the "Sell only by packaging" is ticked on product.

For example, 
- To sell packaging (fill positive product quantities), if your packaging is set to sell by 5 units and the employee fill
the quantity with 3, the quantity will be automatically replaced by 5 (it always rounds up to the nearest multiple of the packaging quantity).

- To return packaging (fill negative product quantities), if your packaging is set with -5 units and the employee fill
the quantity with -3, the quantity will be automatically replaced by -5 (it always rounds down to the nearest multiple of the packaging quantity).

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

Following options are available to define which packaging level can be sold and
which product can only be sold by packaging.

* Sell only by packaging: On product template model, this checkbox restricts
  sales of these products if no packaging is selected on the sale order line.
  If no packaging is selected, it will either be auto-assigned if the quantity
  on the sale order line matches a packaging quantity or an error will be raised.

* Force sale quantity (on the packaging): force rounds up the quantity during
  creation/modification of the sale order line with the factor set on the packaging.
