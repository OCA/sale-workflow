Configuration
=============

On partners form view, under the "Sales & Purchases" tab, one can define a
"Delivery schedule preference" for each partner.

Possible configurations are:

* Any time: Do not postpone deliveries
* Fixed time windows: Postpone deliveries to the next preferred time window

After selecting "Fixed time windows", one can define the preferred delivery
windows in the embedded tree view below.

Usage
=====

As the delivery schedule is a preference, the schedule date of delivery orders
can always be changed to a datetime that is not preferred by the customer either
by setting a commitment date on sale order or by changing the date on the
picking.
