This module simplifies and emphasizes the usage of packaging in sales orders.

- Packaging fields in sale order lines appear before product quantity fields.
- When selecting a product to sell, its default packaging is added automatically.

Why is this module useful? Packaging usage in Odoo is designed to be computed
automatically when you choose the final amount of products to sell. Although
you can still do that, with this module the natural usage is inverted: it's
easier for you to select the packaging and quantity first, and then the final
amount of products is computed automatically.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Configuration > Settings*.
#. Under *Product Catalog*, enable *Product Packagings*.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to configure a product with packaging:

#. Go to *Sales > Products > Products* and select or create a product.
#. In the *Inventory* tab, add some packaging(s).
#. Enable *Sales* and *Default for sales* in one packaging.

Then you have to sell it:

#. Go to *Sales > Orders > Quotations* and create a new quotation.
#. Select any customer.
#. Add the product with packaging.

You will notice that the product is added with the default sale packaging, and
the quantity is set to 1 packaging unit.
