Use Cases / Context
===================

Some companies, like food distributors, need to emphasize the usage of
product packaging in the sale process.

Product packaging in Odoo is designed to be computed automatically when
you choose the final amount of products to sell. For example, if you
sell 12 kgs of apples and those can be packaged by bags of 4kg, you'll
get automatically suggested to sell 3 bags.

Although you can still do that, with this module the natural usage is
inverted: it's easier for you to select the packaging and quantity
first, and then the final amount of products is computed automatically.
Following the same example, you'll choose bags, then 3, and then the
12kg will be computed automatically.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Sales > Configuration > Settings*.
2. Under *Product Catalog*, enable *Product Packagings*.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to configure a product with packaging:

1. Go to *Sales > Products > Products* and select or create a product.
2. In the *Inventory* tab, add some packaging(s).
3. Enable *Sales* and in one packaging.
4. Sort the packaging options at will. The first one enabled for *Sales*
   will be considered the default one.

Then you have to sell it:

1. Go to *Sales > Orders > Quotations* and create a new quotation.
2. Select any customer.
3. Select that product.

You will notice that:

-  The product is added with the default sale packaging.
-  The packaging quantity is set to 1 packaging unit.
-  The product UoM quantity is set to the amount of units contained in 1
   packaging.
