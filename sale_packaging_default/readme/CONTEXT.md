Some companies, like food distributors, need to emphasize the usage of product
packaging in the sale process.

Product packaging in Odoo is designed to be computed automatically when you
choose the final amount of products to sell. For example, if you sell 12 kgs of
apples and those can be packaged by bags of 4kg, you'll get automatically
suggested to sell 3 bags.

Although you can still do that, with this module the natural usage is inverted:
it's easier for you to select the packaging and quantity first, and then the
final amount of products is computed automatically. Following the same example,
you'll choose bags, then 3, and then the 12kg will be computed automatically.
