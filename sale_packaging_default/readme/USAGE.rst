To use this module, you need to configure a product with packaging:

#. Go to *Sales > Products > Products* and select or create a product.
#. In the *Inventory* tab, add some packaging(s).
#. Enable *Sales* and *Default for sales* in one packaging.

Then you have to sell it:

#. Go to *Sales > Orders > Quotations* and create a new quotation.
#. Select any customer.
#. Add the product with packaging.

You will notice that the product is added with the default sale packaging, and
the quantity is set to 1 packaging unit.
