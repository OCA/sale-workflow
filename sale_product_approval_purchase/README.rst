Configuration
=============

* The product states are configured to allow/block workflows for the purchase order.
* The product is configured via check boxes.
* The 'Can be' check boxes are readonly and controlled by the state configuration boxes and set accordingly based on the product state settings.

Usage
=====

* A User will not be able to manually add a product that is not in an approved state for PO.

* If a product is moved to a state where the 'Approved to be Purchased' is not set, then the purchase order will show an exception:

* If a user tries clicks the 'Confirm Order' button, then a warning shows informing the user that there is an exception.
