By default, portal users are allowed to see all the orders and invoices in
which a member of their organization are followers. That could cause a leaking
of  documents between members and departments and of the organization that
should stay private.

This module restricts that behaviour so the portal users only see their own
documents.

Usage
=====

#. Create some portal users belonging to the same company.
#. Place some orders for several of these users.
#. Log in with each portal user credential.
#. Only the orders and invoices belonging to the logged in user's partner or
   his descendants should be accessible.
#. Invoices associated to a partner's sale order will be visible as well.
