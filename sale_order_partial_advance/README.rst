Sale Order Partial Advance
===========================

This module was written to extend the sale advance management. It allows to
use an advance amount progressively when you invoices only some order lines.

Example:
    You create a sale order with 4 differents products for a total amount of 2000.
    The customer pays an advance of 600. All the products will not be delivered 
    in the same time and, once you invoice the first delivery,
    you want to keep a part of the advance as warranty and only deduct 400
    from the 600 paid.
