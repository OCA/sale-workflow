This module provides a way to classify partners using Odooâ€™s native
**utm.source** model. Each partner can be assigned a Source, which is
added just below the partner's name on the form view. When creating a
Quotation, the Source field of the partner is automatically copied to
the Quotation. Users can manually adjust the Source in the Quotation if
needed.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Odoo does not natively provide the ability to track the origin of
customers through a Source field. This module addresses that by allowing
each Partner to have a Source assigned. The Source is automatically
copied to the Quotation when it is created
