This module extends the functionality of Sales to allow you to see the price
history of a product from a sale order line and set one of these old prices in
the sale order line.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales -> Quotations* and select a Quotation.
#. Click on the new clock button in one of the sale order lines.
#. A pop-up will open and you will see the *price history* for the product of
   the sale order line and for the customer of the sale order.
#. You can select other customer or leave it empty to see the price history for
   all customers.
#. You can also set the price of one of the price history lines in the sale
   order line. To do that, you have to open the price history line desired and
   click the smart button named *Set price*.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The number of entries of prices history in the wizard should be configurable,
  currently it is limited to 20.
* A backend tour would be nice to have.
* It is not possible to set a price from the tree view of the wizard lines,
  currently it can only be done from the form view of those lines
  (by clicking on one of them). This is not solved by simply putting a
  'Set price' button in the wizard lines because that button will be
  disabled since when the wizard is launched there is still no wizard
  record in the database (this is an Odoo limitation).
