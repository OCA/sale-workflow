* The number of entries of prices history in the wizard should be configurable,
  currently it is limited to 20.
* A backend tour would be nice to have.
* It is not possible to set a price from the tree view of the wizard lines,
  currently it can only be done from the form view of those lines
  (by clicking on one of them). This is not solved by simply putting a
  'Set price' button in the wizard lines because that button will be
  disabled since when the wizard is launched there is still no wizard
  record in the database (this is an Odoo limitation).
