* The *Customer* column of the *price history lines* list is not hidden when
  there is a specific client selected because odoo doesn't allow
  showing/hiding a column from a *list view* dynamically
  (based on any condition).
* The number of entries of prices history in the wizard should be configurable,
  currently it is limited to 20.
* In the sale order line, the new button with clock icon will not be activated
  until the line is saved.
