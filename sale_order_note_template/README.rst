How this module differ from `sale_comment_template`_?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `base_comment_template`_ is for managing comments not terms, it would probably
  see as mess for users to mixed terms and comments.

* `sale_comment_template`_ depends on `account_comment_template`_ comments are
  forwards to generated invoices, here we don't really display sales terms on
  final invoices

* `base_comment_template`_ at the time writing do not support template engine


.. _base_comment_template: https://github.com/OCA/reporting-engine/tree/14.0/base_comment_template
.. _sale_comment_template: https://github.com/OCA/sale-reporting/tree/14.0/sale_comment_template
.. _account_comment_template: https://github.com/OCA/account-invoice-reporting/tree/14.0/account_comment_template
