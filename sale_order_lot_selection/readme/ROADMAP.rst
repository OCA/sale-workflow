Block sale order validation on confirmation if the selected lot has been removed of this module
Indeed nobody seems to know  what it had been implemented on early versions and it is really blocking other generic use case.
One may want to validate a sale order restricting it to a lot that will be produced for instance and does not exist yet.

This feature may be easyly put it back, in a separated module, if a use case requires it.
The removal of this feature was made on this commit : 3234b2ccccf1dffafbe0a8fa8efaaea44f2e47ef.
