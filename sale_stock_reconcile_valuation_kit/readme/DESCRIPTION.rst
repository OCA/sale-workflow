This module will try to reconcile the stock interim accounts associated with the sale of kits,
when the Anglo Saxon accounting is used and the inventory valuation of the products is automated.

When the customer invoice is posted, the system will attempt to reconcile the journal items associated with
interim accounts with the journal items associated with the stock moves related with components of the kit product
that was invoiced.
