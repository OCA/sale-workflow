This module allows to select which sale order lines you would like to
confirm. It also can create a new quotation in the "Cancel" state with
all the unconfirmed lines from the original quotation in case you need
to keep that information.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Sometimes you need to confirm only selected lines of a Sales Order. Eg
your customer has asked you a quotation for a desk, five chairs and a
sofa. However in the end he decides to order only a desk and 2 chairs.

Configuration
=============

Go to "Sales -> Configuration -> Settings" and scroll down to the
"Quotation & Orders" section. Enable the "Partial Confirmation"
checkbox. Enable the "Save Unconfirmed Items" checkbox if you want to
create a quotation with all the unconfirmed items. Define a suffix for
the unconfirmed items quotation in the "Unconfirmed Quotation Suffix"
field. If no suffix is defined then a standard "-U" suffix will be used.
Eg "SO00023-U".

Usage
=====

Open a quotation and click the "Confirm" button. A wizard will pop-up
with the following options available:

-  "All Items"
-  "Selected Items"

Choose "Selected Items", set the lines quantities you want to confirm in
the list below and click "Confirm". If you don't want to confirm
specific lines at all, just set their quantity to 0. Note, that
confirmed quantity cannot be negative or greater than ordered quantity
of related SO line. If you put invalid quantity, you'll be notified via
error message. Quotation will be updated according to your selection and
confirmed.

If you have enabled "Save Unconfirmed Items" in the settings a new
quotation in the "Cancel" state will be created with all the lines that
were not confirmed. Internal note "Created from will be posted in the
chatter of the unconfirmed lines quotation. Internal note "Unconfirmed
lines are saved in will be posted in the chatter of the confirmed sales
order.
