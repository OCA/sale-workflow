This module allows to create a project from quotation without confirming
it. It can also create tasks from sales order lines. Important
difference is that it allows to create task for any product type not
just services.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Sometimes you need to perform some activities before confirming a
quotation.  Eg you need to do some technical research in order to
calculate sales price for the items being sold.

Configuration
=============

-  Go to "Sales -> Settings" and scroll to the "Quotations & Orders"
   section
-  Activate the "Create Projects From Quotation" checkbox
-  Select a project to be used as a template in the "Template Project"
   field
-  Optional: select a pre-defined task template in the "Template Task"
   field

NB: you can select from both active and archived projects/tasks in these
fields.

Usage
=====

Open quotation and click the  "Create quotation project" from the
"Action" menu.

|Action menu|

A wizard will be shown with the following selection options:

-  Create a project. Will create a new empty project.
-  Create a project with task per line. Will create a new project and a
   task for each quotation  line.
-  Create a project with task per product. Will create a new project and
   a task for each product of the quotation.

When creating tasks task template will be used. Task name will be
replaced with a quotation line description. If the "tasks per product"
option is used then task name will be populated from the first quotation
line that contains that product. If not task template is defined an
empty task will be created with a name only.

If you want to create tasks only for some quotation lines you can remove
the lines you don't need from the wizard line list.

|Wizard|

New field "Quotation line" is added to Task. It's used to link tasks
with quotations without breaking the standard Odoo flow. This allows to
use task both during the quotation and sales order sales phases.

|Task view|

To access related projects from quotation you can use the existing
"Projects" smart button on the quotation form.
