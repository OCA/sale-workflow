Use Cases / Context
===================

Sometimes you need to compute sales price based on values obtained from
custom sources. Eg you receive your purchase prices dynamically from a
vendor using API.

However by default Odoo has only limited options for a pricelist price
base:

-  Sales Price
-  Cost
-  Other Pricelist

Configuration
=============

Create a new one or select an existing pricelist with "Computation" mode
set to "Formula".

In the pricelist:

-  Select "Formula" in the "Computation" selector.
-  Select "Custom Value" in the "Based on" field.

Usage
=====

This is a technical module which means it's designed to be used as a
part of custom solutions. You need to add your price as
**custom_base_price**\ ​ kwargs key when calling **\_get_product_price**
function of the **product.pricelist** ​model.
