This module links the 'Can be sold' field to the states. The states then control whether or not the product can be sold or not in the particular state.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

*	Create product states.
*	Check the 'Approved to be sold' box on the states where the product is allowed to be sold when it's in that state.

Usage
=====

* When a product is moved to a state where it's approved, the 'Can be sold' box should be checked and the product is selectable on sales quotes.
* If the product is not in a state where it's approved to be sold, then the 'Can be sold' check box is not checked and the product can not be added to sales quotes.
* If it's not approved, any sales quote that already contained the product will show a warning and have an exception activity.
