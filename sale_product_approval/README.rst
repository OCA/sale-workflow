This module links the 'Can be sold' field to the states. The states then
control whether or not the product can be sold or not in the particular
state.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
   `More details on development status <https://odoo-community.org/page/development-status>`_

Configuration
=============

-  Create product states.
-  Check the 'Approved to be added to SO' box on the states where the
   product is allowed to be added to an SO when it's in that state.
-  Check the 'Approved to be sold' box on the states where the product
   is allowed to be sold when it's in that state.

Usage
=====

-  When a product is moved to a state where it's approved, the 'Can be
   sold' box should be checked and the product is selectable on sales
   quotes.
-  If the product is not in a state where it's approved to be sold, then
   the 'Can be sold' check box is not checked and the product can not be
   added to sales quotes.
-  If it's not approved, any sales quote that already contained the
   product will show a warning and have an exception activity.
