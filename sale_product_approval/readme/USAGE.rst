* When a product is moved to a state where it's approved, the 'Can be sold' box should be checked and the product is selectable on sales quotes.
* If the product is not in a state where it's approved to be sold, then the 'Can be sold' check box is not checked and the product can not be added to sales quotes.
* If it's not approved, any sales quote that already contained the product will show a warning and have an exception activity.
