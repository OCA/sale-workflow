- When a product is moved to a state where it's approved, the 'Can be
  sold' box should be checked and the product is selectable on sales
  quotes.
- If the product is not in a state where it's approved to be sold, then
  the 'Can be sold' check box is not checked and the product can not be
  added to sales quotes.
- If it's not approved, any sales quote that already contained the
  product will show a warning and have an exception activity.
