Sale Start End Dates
====================

This module adds the fields *start date* and *end date* on sale order
lines. Upon invoice creation, the value of the start/end dates of the
sale order line is copied to the start/end dates of invoice lines. This
module is a technical module: it is designed to be used with other
modules such as the *sale_rental* module.
