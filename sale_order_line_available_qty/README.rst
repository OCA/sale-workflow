Sale Order Line Available QTY
=============================

This module adds the available quantity of the product on the sale order line.

The quantity available is the current stock for the product in the selected warehouse including
the quants reserved for the sale order but excluding quants reserved for other sale orders.

The sale order line will be displayed in red if the available quantity is insufficient (if the product selected is stockable).
