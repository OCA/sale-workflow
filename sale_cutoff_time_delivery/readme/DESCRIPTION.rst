This module allows to define Cutoff times for delivery orders.

If no commitment date is set, any sale order confirmed after the applicable
cutoff time will have its delivery order postponed by one day at the time of
the applicable cutoff, and any sale order confirmed before the applicable
cutoff time will have its delivery order postponed to the time of the applicable
cutoff.
