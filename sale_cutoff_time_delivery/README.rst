This module allows to define Cutoff times for delivery orders.

If no commitment date is set, any sale order confirmed after the applicable
cutoff time will have its delivery order postponed by one day at the time of
the applicable cutoff, and any sale order confirmed before the applicable
cutoff time will have its delivery order postponed to the time of the applicable
cutoff.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

Application of cutoff is defined by partner, with default value being the
cutoff time of the sale order's warehouse.

Cut-off must however be applied on the warehouse by marking the checkbox
"Apply cutoff" so that the computation happens.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Storing times using `float_time` widget requires extra processing to ensure
  computations are done in the right timezone, because the value is not stored
  as UTC in the database, and must therefore be related to a `tz` field.

  `float_time` in this sense should only be used for durations and not for a
  "point in time" as this is always needs a Date for a timezone conversion to
  be done properly. (Because a conversion from UTC to e.g. Europe/Brussels won't
  give the same result in winter or summer because of Daylight Saving Time).

  Therefore the right move would be to use a `resource.calendar` to define
  cutoff time using Datetime with recurrences.
